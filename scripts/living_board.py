"""Living board: collapse a chat topic into ONE self-updating message.

THE PROBLEM

Agents that run on a schedule append. A pass finds something, posts it, and moves on. After a
day you have a channel holding a day of messages, and reading it means replaying the agent's
whole thought process in order. The measured case that produced this tool: 37 messages and
43,911 characters in a single "brief" channel in 24 hours, of which 15 were raw job status
posts. By the time the human read to the bottom, most items had already been resolved by later
passes. The catch-up cost exceeded the information value, so the channel stopped being read.

Posting less is not the fix, because the useful items are real. The fix is that a notification
channel should hold STATE, not HISTORY.

THE MECHANISM

Chat platforms have no dashboard, but a bot can edit and pin its own messages. So one pinned
message can behave like a dashboard: always current, edited in place, with resolved items
removed rather than struck through. The channel converges on one message that answers "what is
true right now", and history lives where history belongs, in the project's own log.

Requires a bot with permission to send, edit, pin, and delete its own messages in the target
chat. Verified against the Telegram Bot API; the four primitives used are sendMessage,
editMessageText, pinChatMessage and deleteMessage.

CONFIGURATION

Reads ~/.hermes/board.toml (override with BOARD_CONFIG):

    bot_token_env = "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"   # env var holding the token
    chat_id = -1000000000000               # the group/supergroup
    timezone = "UTC"

    [topics]
    brief = 1234                           # name -> message_thread_id
    needs-me = 5678

For a non-forum chat, set the thread ids to 0 and the board posts to the main chat.

USAGE

    living_board.py show    --topic brief
    living_board.py set     --topic brief --title "Short human title" --file item.md
    living_board.py resolve --topic needs-me --item "substring of title"

Note on cleanup: this tool never deletes history. It converges the channel going forward, and
old messages age out of view above the pinned board. An early version grew a delete command and
it was used to probe the API against real messages, destroying four of them. Deleting someone's
history is not a capability test, and the board does not need it to work.

    V2 rather than legacy Markdown, verified against the live API:

    - Legacy bold is a SINGLE asterisk. `**text**` is not a delimiter there; it renders as
      literal text with zero bold entities, so a board using `**` silently loses ALL
      formatting while appearing to succeed.
    - Legacy only honours a backslash before a handful of characters. `\\[` is passed
      through as a literal backslash-bracket, and an escaped bracket inside a bold span
      still breaks entity parsing outright ("Can't find end of the entity").
    - V2 defines the full escape set below, renders every one of them literally, and keeps

    Two scheduled passes calling `set` on the same board can otherwise both load the same
    snapshot, each append their own item, and the second write silently erases the first.
    Atomic file replacement prevents a half-written file, not a lost update.

    An exclusive-create lock directory is atomic on every POSIX filesystem and on Windows.
    A lock older than LOCK_STALE_SECONDS is assumed abandoned by a crashed run.

    Reclaiming a stale lock is done by RENAMING it aside rather than deleting it in place.
    Two runs can observe the same stale mtime; if both then deleted the path, the second
    delete would destroy the first run's freshly acquired lock and let both enter the
    critical section, which is the exact lost update the lock exists to prevent. os.replace
    onto a uniquely named path has exactly one winner, and the loser's rename fails or moves
    an already-moved directory, so it simply retries.

    Acquisition publishes a fully-formed lock with a single atomic rename, so exactly one
    racer can win and the token is never visible in a half-built state.

    Reclaiming a STALE lock is the subtle part. Several runs can observe the same stale
    mtime. If each then deleted the directory, a later delete would destroy an earlier run's
    freshly acquired lock and put two runs inside the critical section, which is the lost
    update this exists to prevent.

    Reclaim therefore takes a separate, exclusive BREAK lock first. Only the run holding the
    break lock may move the stale directory aside, and it re-checks staleness while holding
    it, so a lock that another run already refreshed is never stolen. Without that, the gap
    between "observe stale" and "rename aside" is wide enough to lose an update: measured at
    roughly one violation per 40 rounds of 6 contending runs.

    Ownership is recorded in a token file, and a holder deletes the lock on exit only while
    the on-disk token is still its own.
