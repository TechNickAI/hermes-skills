# Robustify Doctor

## Overview

Most agent monitoring answers "did the process exit 0?" That question misses the failure
class that actually hurts: the job that ran, exited clean, and did nothing. The backup
that failed 573 consecutive times while its launchd unit reported success. The seven
scheduled jobs that had never executed once, two of which were health checks.

This skill is deliberately split in two:

1. **`scripts/robustify_collect.py`** — deterministic, stdlib-only, no LLM, no network.
   It gathers facts and refuses to interpret them. Every collector is fail-soft: a
   broken collector reports its own failure rather than killing the run.

   It is read-only against everything it inspects, with **one deliberate exception**: it
   maintains its own small SQLite history at `$HERMES_HOME/robustify/disk_history.db` so
   it can report a disk _trajectory_ rather than a single instantaneous number. Rows
   older than 30 days are pruned each run. It never writes to any database it monitors.

2. **You** — you read the fact sheet and do the part a script cannot: correlate across
   subsystems, decide what is a real incident versus an artifact, and choose what to fix
   versus escalate.

The split matters. A pure-threshold monitor produces alerts nobody trusts, because the
interesting failures are the ones nobody wrote a threshold for. Judgment is the product;
the script is an instrument.

## When to Use

- A scheduled health check (see cadence below)
- After a host reboot, an upgrade, or a service migration
- Someone asks "is my agent working?" / "why did it go quiet?"
- An agent has stopped producing output and you don't yet know why
- Before and after any risky change, as a before/after comparison

**Don't use for:** diagnosing a single known-broken job (read its log directly), or
anything requiring live probes of third-party integrations — this collector never makes
a network call and never writes to anything it inspects. (It does maintain its own
disk-history database; see the exception noted above.)

## Several agents on one machine

Multiple agents often share a host, each with its own `HERMES_HOME`. They all see the
same disk and the same process table, so if every one of them alerts on host-level
facts, a single full disk becomes four identical incidents.

Designate one agent per **machine** (not per owner) as the host reporter:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HERMES_HOME/robustify"
echo no > "$HERMES_HOME/robustify/host_reporter"   # co-tenant: collect, don't alert
echo yes > "$HERMES_HOME/robustify/host_reporter"  # designated reporter
```

Every agent still runs the full collector — the host-level facts remain useful context
for diagnosing that agent's own problems. Only the alerting duty is assigned. The report
states which role it is in via `host_level_reporter: yes|no`.

**An absent marker means yes.** A fresh single-agent host must alert on its own disk
without any setup; the failure mode of the opposite default is silence.

Co-tenancy is a property of the host. Two agents owned by the same person on two
different boxes are not co-tenants — each is its own reporter.

## Running it

```bash
python3 scripts/robustify_collect.py              # ~1-2s, all collectors
python3 scripts/robustify_collect.py --deep       # force PRAGMA quick_check on every db
python3 scripts/robustify_collect.py --show-host  # real hostname instead of a hash
```

The hostname is hashed by default (`host-c3263a4b`) so reports can be pasted into
tickets and chats without leaking machine names; `--show-host` opts in. Paths under the
home directory are rewritten to `~` / `$HERMES_HOME` on output.

Against another agent's home, or another host:

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/path/to/other/.hermes python3 scripts/robustify_collect.py
ssh <host> 'python3 -' < scripts/robustify_collect.py
```

Pipe the script over stdin rather than quoting it into `ssh ... python3 -c`. Multiline
inline shell over SSH silently returns a single blank line often enough to waste an
hour.

**What `--deep` actually changes.** Databases under 200MB are quick-checked on _every_
run because it is cheap; `--deep` forces the check on the large ones too. On a multi-GB
state database that costs ~20-40s, which is fine daily and too slow every 15 minutes.
The label distinguishes the two outcomes precisely: `integrity=ok(quick_check)` means
the check ran and passed, `integrity=readable(deep-check-skipped)` means only that the
file opened and answered a query. Never read the second as the first.

## Reading the output

Prompt yourself (or a sub-agent) with the collector report and these instructions:

```
You are a systems diagnostic agent. Below is deterministic collector output —
facts only, no interpretation.

1. CORRELATE across domains. Group related facts into single incidents rather
   than listing symptoms separately.
2. Classify each finding: BROKEN NOW / WILL BREAK SOON / COSMETIC / NOT A PROBLEM.
3. For each real finding: state the likely cause, the evidence line(s) it rests
   on, and which escalation tier it falls into (see the ladder below). Do not
   invent a repair authorization the ladder does not grant.
4. Explicitly call out anything that looks alarming but is actually FINE —
   false-positive suppression matters as much as detection.
5. Note what you CANNOT determine from this data and what you'd collect next.

Rules:
- Every claim must cite a specific line from the collector output.
- Do not recommend deleting user data.
- Be concise and concrete. No preamble.
```

Point 4 is not decoration. Roughly half of what looks alarming in a first report is
benign, and a monitor that cries wolf gets ignored within a week.

## Interpretation traps

These are wrong readings that were made against real data. The collector emits the
disambiguating fact in each case — use it.

1. **Output staleness is measured against each job's own schedule, not a flat number.**
   `output_stale_vs_own_cadence_enabled` already accounts for weekly and monthly jobs; a
   weekly job with 60-hour-old output is healthy and is not counted.
   `output_stale_total` is the raw count including disabled jobs and is expected to be
   larger — do not report it as the problem count.

1. **A stale `running` row is not a stalled job.** On one host, 3 of 4 long-running rows
   belonged to jobs that had since completed 26-85 times: orphan rows from a crash. The
   collector separates `jobs_stalled_no_later_completion` (real) from
   `jobs_orphan_running_rows_benign` (noise). Age alone is the wrong discriminator; the
   presence of a _later terminal run for the same job_ is the right one.

1. **"No row in executions.db" does not mean "never ran."** That database retains ~20
   hours on a busy host. The collector distinguishes `jobs_no_evidence_of_ever_running`
   (no execution row AND no output file — real) from
   `jobs_last_ran_before_retention_window` (ran, just outside the window — expected).
   Always read `execution_retention_hours` before drawing conclusions about job history.

1. **A nonzero launchd `last_exit` may predate a manual fix.** It is the last run's
   code, not current state. Corroborate with the unit's own log age, which the collector
   emits as `last_run_log_age_h`.

1. **High restart counts are not an outage.** `restarts=262` alongside
   `current_uptime=7.3h` means it crashed a lot historically and is stable now. Both
   facts matter; neither alone tells the story.

1. **`integrity=readable(deep-check-skipped)` is not `integrity=ok`.** It means the
   database opened and answered a query. Run `--deep` before claiming integrity.

1. **Backup success counts are meaningless without the consecutive-failure count.** 4
   successes and 573 failures is a broken backup, not a working one. Conversely
   `consecutive_failures: 0` with a recent `last_success_hours_ago` is healthy no matter
   how ugly the lifetime failure count looks.

1. **`stale_immutable_reads` in the self-health section invalidates conclusions.** It
   means a database could only be opened with `immutable=1`, which ignores the `-wal`
   file. Anything derived from that database may reflect a pre-checkpoint image — re-run
   before acting on it.

1. **A hashed hostname is stable per machine.** `host-c3263a4b` is the same box across
   runs, so it still groups a fleet correctly without naming anything. Use `--show-host`
   only for local reading.

## Pitfalls found building this

1. **`pgrep` excludes itself and all its ancestors.** When this collector runs inside an
   agent, that agent's own gateway is invisible to `pgrep`. Verified: a host's own
   gateway was silently missing from every report while four siblings appeared normally.
   A monitor blind to the agent running it is worse than none. The collector uses
   `ps -axo` for this reason — do not "simplify" it back to `pgrep`.

2. **Unanchored process patterns match unrelated processes.** `hermes.*gateway` matched
   a node test runner in a checkout whose path contained "hermes", inflating the gateway
   count and reporting a 14MB RSS that belonged to the wrong process entirely.

3. **Unanchored launchd label matching is worse.** A filter that included an agent
   nickname as a bare alternation matched two unrelated Apple system daemons whose names
   merely contained those three letters, and reported them as failing Hermes services.
   Never match service labels on a short substring. Anchor on `^ai\.hermes\.`.

4. **`sqlite3.connect(file:X?mode=ro)` is lazy.** It succeeds at connect time and only
   raises on the first query, because a WAL database needs a `-shm` sidecar that
   read-only mode forbids. The collector's `ro_connect()` validates with a real query
   before returning and falls back to `immutable=1`.

5. **FTS5 `integrity-check` is a WRITE.** `INSERT INTO t(t) VALUES('integrity-check')`
   on a read-only handle raises "readonly database", which is _not_ corruption.
   Reporting it as corruption is a false alarm on a scary-sounding subject.

6. **Sampling only the first gateway PID hides the bloated one.** Report RSS per
   profile.

## Cadence

Layer the checks; each catches what the one above cannot see.

| Frequency | Scope                                       | LLM?                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 5 min     | disk and memory hard limits                 | no — needs a separate threshold alarm (below) |
| 30 min    | gateway presence, database readability      | no                                            |
| Hourly    | full collector + LLM read, auto-fix in-lane | yes, cheap model                              |
| Daily     | `--deep`, backup verification, digest       | yes, escalate to a stronger model on findings |

**The 5-minute row is not this collector.** This script emits facts; it has no
thresholds and raises no alarms. A sub-minute alarm plane is a separate, much dumber
script that compares two numbers and exits silent when healthy. Do not schedule this
collector every 5 minutes and assume you have hard-limit alerting — you would have a
fact sheet nobody reads, which is how the "watchdog reported healthy while broken"
failure happens.

**Run it from outside the agent it monitors as well as inside.** A wedged agent cannot
report that it is wedged; every self-check runs inside the process that would be down.
External observation is the only way to detect total failure, and disagreement between
the internal and external view is itself a signal.

## Escalation

Tier 2 is an **allowlist, not a category**. If the specific action is not on this list,
it is tier 3, no matter how safe it feels. "Restart it" is not self-evidently
reversible: restarting a gateway drops in-flight work, and clearing a cache can destroy
the very evidence needed to diagnose the cause.

1. **Log** — within variance, or a first occurrence that self-resolved
2. **Auto-fix (allowlisted actions only)** — each requires the stated evidence first:
   rotate or truncate a log file, given `LARGE_LOG` plus a confirmed rotation gap;
   re-run a single failed job, given `FAILING_JOB ... STILL_FAILING` and a job known to
   be idempotent; restart a gateway that is absent from `PROCESSES` while its supervisor
   expects it. Anything else, including config edits, is tier 3.
3. **Surface, don't fix** — anything touching user-visible data, credentials, memory,
   prompts, or state that a wrong fix would corrupt; anything with no confirmed cause;
   anything already attempted twice. A silently-mangling job auto-repaired is worse than
   one left broken.
4. **Wake a human** — blast radius is fleet-wide, or repair attempts are exhausted.
   Always with cause and blast radius attached, never a raw alert.

**Verify after fixing.** Force-run the job and confirm the symptom is gone. Exit 0 is
not verification — that is the same mistake this skill exists to catch.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `collectors_failed: 0` in `COLLECTOR_SELF_HEALTH` — a partial report read as a
      complete one is how you conclude "healthy" about a subsystem that never reported
- [ ] Every gateway you expect appears in `PROCESSES`, including the agent's own
- [ ] `execution_retention_hours` read before any claim about job history
- [ ] `--deep` run before any claim about database integrity
- [ ] Every finding cites a specific line from the report
- [ ] Benign-but-alarming items explicitly called out as benign
