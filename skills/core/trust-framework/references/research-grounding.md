# Research Grounding

Every construct in the trust framework maps to an established, named precedent. This is
the "why each design choice exists" layer, useful when defending the design or extending
it.

## The mapping

## The named frameworks

**NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0 + Generative AI Profile).** Four
functions, Govern, Map, Measure, Manage. The GenAI Profile explicitly names "Human-AI
Configuration" risk (over-reliance / automation bias) as a thing to manage. The periodic
self-audit is the Measure/Manage step; every bucket having an owner, a risk class, a
measured signal, and a rollback path is the Govern step.

**EU AI Act (risk tiers).** Unacceptable / high / limited / minimal risk, with high-risk
systems required to have _effective human oversight_. The framework borrows the
proportionality principle (oversight scales with consequence) and the carve-out logic
that narrow, procedural, review-assisting tasks are inherently lower-tier, good L2/L3
candidates.

**SAE levels of automation (J3016) + agent levels-of-autonomy taxonomies.** The
canonical analogy: each level corresponds to a different human attention requirement.
The key adaptation is that autonomy levels mirror the _human's role_ (approver →
observer), not the agent's raw capability. Capability is not permission.

**One-way vs two-way doors.** The reversibility heuristic: irreversible decisions get
heavyweight review; reversible ones move fast. Adopted as the primary classification
axis.

**Blast radius (SRE / security).** Scope of harm: self → single record → owned systems →
external people → public. Used as the multiplier on reversibility.

**Principle of least privilege + RACI / RAPID.** Grant minimum scopes; expand on
demonstrated need. Separate _who decides_ from _who executes_, the agent is
Responsible/Performs while the human stays Accountable/Decides.

**Selective prediction / learning to defer.** Models should abstain and hand off when
uncertain. Production handoff thresholds scale with consequence (~0.9 for high-risk /
one-way, ~0.7 for low-risk / reversible). LLMs run overconfident, so calibrate stated
confidence against realized outcomes.

**Organizational trust models.** Probationary periods → the mandatory L1 start.
Delegation-of-Authority signing limits → per-level authority caps. Apprenticeship /
competency ladders (apprentice → journeyman → master) → domain-specific promotion.
Performance-review cadences → the periodic review. "Trust but verify" → autonomy plus
persistent sampling.

**SRE error budgets.** Exceed the failure budget and autonomy auto-freezes until
reliability recovers. Adopted directly as the automatic-demotion trigger.

## Three load-bearing principles

1. **Capability ≠ permission.** Promotion is earned per skill area and gated by
   reversibility, never granted because the agent is technically able.
2. **Oversight must stay meaningful.** Avoid rubber-stamp L1 (per-action approval at
   scale trains the human to stop reading) and L2/L3 complacency (sampled audit, surface
   uncertainty, review reasoning not just output).
3. **Trust is non-monotonic.** Error budgets and review cadences demote as readily as
   track records promote.
