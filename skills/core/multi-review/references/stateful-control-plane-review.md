# Stateful Control-Plane Review Recipe

Use this reference for event journals, workflow engines, schedulers, durable job systems, governance control planes, and other stateful systems whose tests may pass while transactional guarantees remain weak.

## Review sequence

1. **Map specification claims to executable enforcement.** Build a checklist for append-only integrity, migrations, idempotency, provenance, acceptance, leases/fencing/retries/cancellation, projections/replay, budgets, communications, monitoring, and disaster recovery. Cite the governing requirement and implementation line for every conclusion.
2. **Run the repository's documented suite independently.** Preserve the exact command, exit code, test count, duration, and output. Passing tests are evidence about covered cases, not proof of the stated guarantees.
3. **Re-inventory immediately before testing and reporting.** Files may appear or change during a long review. Include newly discovered implementation/tests, rerun the complete suite, and avoid reporting an obsolete test count.
4. **Probe adversarial transaction boundaries in isolated temporary state.** Never mutate canonical/project state. Favor small deterministic probes over speculative findings.
5. **Separate mechanism from enforcement.** A stored fencing token is not fencing unless every side effect validates it; an evidence ID field is not evidence verification; a budget ledger is not an enforced envelope; a receipt row is not immutable merely because the event journal is.
6. **Verify review non-interference.** Prefer VCS status/diff. If the target is not a repository, hash in-scope source files before and after and state that hash comparison was the fallback. Exclude the requested report artifact from the no-modification comparison.

## High-value adversarial probes

### Acceptance and authority

- Attempt to set lifecycle status directly through an ordinary event payload instead of the governed acceptance transition.
- Use nonexistent evidence IDs.
- Set verifier identity equal to worker/actor identity.
- Check that evidence and verification records exist, satisfy the criterion, and are independent or deterministic.

### Idempotency

- Replay the identical request with the same key: it should return one commitment.
- Reuse the key with a different event type, aggregate, or payload: it should fail as a conflict, not silently return the old result.
- Check the request fingerprint excludes generated IDs/timestamps while covering all semantic command fields.

### Event append and projection

- Feed schema-invalid or projector-breaking payloads.
- Determine whether append and projection/checkpoint are atomic. If asynchronous by design, verify a durable retry/dead-letter path and that an idempotent retry advances the projection.
- Rebuild from the journal and compare normalized state, not just row counts.

### Migration safety

- In a temporary database, run a migration containing valid DDL followed by invalid SQL.
- Verify there is no unledgered partial schema after failure, or that a deliberately recorded failure state makes recovery deterministic.
- Verify applied-checksum drift rejection separately; it does not prove failure atomicity.

### Leases, retries, cancellation, and fencing

- Request an actively held item as a second holder; require explicit conflict/no-acquisition rather than returning another holder's credentials.
- Expire and reacquire; token must increase monotonically.
- Attempt a stale worker commit with the old token; every side-effect boundary must reject it.
- Try raising the retry cap on a later acquisition; policy should be immutable or separately governed.
- Verify heartbeat/renewal, release, timeout, cancellation propagation, and denial of post-cancellation commits.

### Receipts and budgets

- Attempt update/delete of immutable receipt/ledger records.
- Check communication expiry, authority grant, exact content hash, recipient/channel scope, transmission time, and provider receipt are fail-closed and appropriately non-null.
- Attempt overspend, reserve races, negative/NaN amounts, wrong units, and reset-boundary errors. A table with enum columns is not budget enforcement.

### Disaster recovery and monitoring

- Restore a backup to an isolated path, run integrity checks, compare event counts, replay projections there, and compare normalized state with the source snapshot.
- Check that monitoring covers the full governance contract, including retry exhaustion, backup age/restore proof, checkpoint age, delivery failure, budget boundaries, and duplicate/noise rates—not only database quick-check.

## Confirmed-defect probe recipes

These four were reproduced against a control plane whose suite was fully green and had
already been signed off. Run them by default; each targets a case an implementer's own
test characteristically misses. See `verifying-a-verdict.md` for why.

### Secrets in embedded/encoded content

A restricted-field validator that inspects **metadata keys** will not see a secret inside
**embedded source bytes**. Write a source file containing `{"apiKey": "sk-live-..."}`,
compile it into the packet/artifact, then base64-decode every manifest entry and grep the
decoded bytes. Assert on decoded content, never on the wrapper.

### Wrong-typed vs missing governed fields

Validators commonly check `required - set(payload)` and stop. Send every required field
**present but nonsensically typed**: `current_question=12345`, `owner={'x':1}`,
`next_action=True`, `cost_to_next_evidence='banana'`. If it stores, schema validation is
structural only, not semantic.

### Concurrent identical idempotent retries

Sequential retry tests pass while concurrent ones fail. Fire two threads with an
identical idempotency key at the same receipt/commit path. Correct behavior is both
returning the same immutable record. A uniqueness error on one thread ("provider receipt
already recorded") means the pre-check and the insert are not serialized against a
concurrent twin.

### Lease validation outside the write transaction

Grep for where `validate_lease` is called relative to `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. If validation
runs before the transaction opens, there is a real read/decide/write race even when the
naive expire-then-reacquire probe is correctly blocked. Report this as **unproven, not
disproven** — a structural weakness whose specific exploit you could not trigger. The
honest fix is making validation and commit share one transaction, which closes it
structurally instead of arguing about a race that is hard to schedule deterministically.

## Evidence and severity

- **Critical:** a declared safety boundary is bypassable, durable state can become unrecoverable/ambiguous, stale work can commit, or authority/acceptance can be forged.
- **Important:** a required contract is materially incomplete, unsafe under failure/concurrency, or only documented rather than enforced.
- **Minor:** metadata mismatch, portability issue, narrow test coverage, or overstated documentation without immediate boundary bypass.

Report both what passes and what fails. For reproduced defects, state the temporary probe and observed result; do not present hypothetical concerns as confirmed behavior.
