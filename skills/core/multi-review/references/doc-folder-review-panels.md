# Reviewing a documentation/spec FOLDER with a multi-model panel

Proven 2026-07-06 on the project's knowledge/ folder (~40 files, ~9,000 lines,
5 reviewers × 5 model families). The SKILL.md covers single artifacts; a
folder needs brief construction. This is the recipe.

## The problem

A whole spec folder cannot go to every reviewer: `hermes -z "$PROMPT"` puts
the prompt on argv, and Linux MAX_ARG_STRLEN is **128KB per single argument**
(`getconf ARG_MAX` shows 2MB total, but the per-arg cap is what bites).
`$(cat file)` does NOT dodge it. A 9k-line folder is ~300KB+ — over the cap.

## The recipe: spine + lens-specific files

1. **Define a SPINE** — the 3–8 docs every reviewer needs (README, vision,
   system overview; optionally the full philosophy set). Two sizes help:
   `spine` (lean, ~20KB) and `full_spine` for the coverage lens.
2. **Per lens, attach only the files that lens judges**:
   - quant/correctness → the math research + the algorithm component specs
   - safety red-team → invariants doc + safety/order components + incident ops
   - buildability ("you are the builder LLM — can you build without
     guessing?") → api/data/infra specs + CI/CD + coding standards
   - coverage/consistency (give to the long-context family) → full spine +
     **first 40–60 lines (TL;DR+) of EVERY doc** instead of full texts —
     contradictions and drift live in the TL;DRs and headers
   - product/strategy → roadmap + decisions + the thesis research
3. **Build briefs with a Python script**, not shell: concat
   `===== FILE: knowledge/<path> =====` separators, `assert len(prompt) <
125000` per brief, write to `/tmp/<review>/p_<lens>.txt`. When an assert
   trips, trim that lens's file list or switch full files → head(40).
4. **Include the folder tree** (`find . -name '*.md' | sort`) in the shared
   header so reviewers can flag references to nonexistent files.
5. **Ask each reviewer for**: severity/confidence/file-location/why/smallest
   fix, plus a final verdict `ready / needs-edits / not-ready to hand to
builder LLMs`.

## Launch (per SKILL.md rules, restated for this shape)

Write one `run_panel.sh` via write*file (never heredoc — the `&` guard
inspects raw command strings): `export HOME=/home/ubuntu`, a `run() { hermes
-z "$(cat p*$1.txt)" --provider "$2" -m "$3" --ignore-rules -t '' >
out*$1.txt 2> err*$1.txt; }`helper, five`run ... &`lines capturing PIDs,`wait`, then `wc -c out\_\*.txt`. Launch with `terminal(background=true,
notify_on_complete=true)`. `bash -n` the script first.

Panel that ran clean on this profile: quant→claude-opus (custom:openrouter),
safety→grok-4.3 (custom:grok), build→gpt-5.2 (custom:openrouter),
coverage→gemini-pro (custom:gemini, the long-context lens), product→think
(custom:omniroute).

## Why lens-specific briefs beat one shared brief here

Different doc subsets ARE the lens: the safety reviewer judging the quoting
math is wasted tokens and anchor risk; the coverage reviewer seeing full
texts of 40 files won't fit. Matching files-to-lens is what makes a folder
review both possible under ARG_MAX and sharper than a single mega-brief.
