# Parallel diverse-model reviewer panel for multi-review.
# Copy + edit the run() lines (name/provider/model/lens) per task.
#
# WHY THIS SHAPE:
#  - One shared brief file keeps every reviewer on identical facts (no anchoring,
#    no per-reviewer drift). Build the brief ONCE in the parent with real tools,
#    reduce to a bounded self-contained doc, then fan it out.
#  - Each reviewer writes its own .txt (stdout) and .err (stderr) so a single
#    hung/failed model can't corrupt the others and you can see partial failures.
#  - All reviewers run in parallel with `&` ... `wait`. 6 lenses finish in the
#    time of the slowest one, not the sum.
#  - Launch THIS script as a Hermes background process (terminal background=true,
#    notify_on_complete=true). Reviewer models are slow with long prompts;
#    blocking the parent turn on them is the classic mistake.
#
# EXECUTION RULES baked in (see SKILL.md "Running reviewers as Hermes one-shots"):
#  - `-t ''`        : disable tools so a headless reviewer can't hang on approval.
#  - `--ignore-rules`: strip the calling persona so the lens isn't washed out.
#                      RE-INJECT any privacy/PII constraints into the brief if the
#                      artifact may contain private data — --ignore-rules drops them.
#  - `timeout`      : 1800s. DO NOT LOWER THIS FOR ANALYTICAL PANELS.
#                      Root-caused 2026-08-15: `timeout 900` was KILLING working
#                      reviewers on a 15KB code-review brief. Measured, same
#                      model + same prompt: killed at 20s -> rc=124 with a
#                      0-byte .txt AND a 0-byte .err; given 900s -> 18,486 bytes,
#                      finishing at 389s. `hermes -z` buffers stdout and writes
#                      at the END, so a kill discards the whole review and leaves
#                      no diagnostic. A SLOW seat and a BROKEN seat look
#                      IDENTICAL. Two models were wrongly written off as dead
#                      this way. Always print rc per seat: rc=124 IS the
#                      diagnosis, and retrying a timeout with the SAME budget
#                      just reproduces it.
#  - isolation   : every reviewer runs in its own throwaway HERMES_HOME
#                  via scripts/reviewer_home.sh, so no reviewer can open
#                  the caller's live state.db. Never remove this.
#  - `export HOME`  : set HOME explicitly. Headless `hermes -z` launched from a
#                      script/subprocess can fail with "Could not determine home
#                      directory" when HOME isn't inherited. Cheap, defensive.
#  - 2>"$OUT/$name.err": keep stderr OUT of the review text so model output stays clean.
