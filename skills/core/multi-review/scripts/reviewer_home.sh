#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Ephemeral, self-destroying scratch homes for headless multi-review reviewers.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# `hermes -z` boots a full agent, and the CLI path opens the CALLING profile's
# state.db read-write (cli.py:4642 SessionDB(), cli.py:8566 create_session(),
# hermes_state.py:2798 _default_db_path()). Run that from an agent whose
# gateway is live and two OS processes write one WAL database -- each with its
# own lock state and its own view of the WAL index. No pragma prevents it.
#
# Measured on a production host: gateway (fd mode 'u') and a
# `hermes -z` reviewer (fd mode 'u') held one state.db simultaneously. That
# 3GB database took structural B-tree damage -- "invalid page number", "2nd
# reference to page", rowids out of order -- and had to be rebuilt offline.
#
# THE MECHANISM
# HERMES_HOME roots config.yaml, .env, auth.json, skills, memories AND
# state.db. A scratch dir seeded with the caller's credentials gives a working
# agent with a PRIVATE database. Nothing is registered under profiles/, so
# there is no namespace to garbage-collect and no name to collide with.
#
# ONE HOME PER REVIEWER, ALWAYS. Measured: 6 concurrent reviewers sharing one
# home produced 6 simultaneous holders of one database -- the original bug,
# relocated. Per-reviewer homes measure a peak of exactly 1.
#
# NO ROLE VOCABULARY. Reviewers are anonymous slots; the caller's PROMPT makes
# one critical and another empathetic. Never enumerate personas here.
#
# USAGE
#   source reviewer_home.sh
#   reviewer_pool_init            # REQUIRED, and never in $( ) -- see below
#   reviewer_run "$PROMPT_A" -m grok   &
#   reviewer_run "$PROMPT_B" -m gemini &
#   wait
#   reviewer_pool_destroy         # or let the EXIT trap do it
#
# HARD-WON CONSTRAINTS (each cost a real bug; do not "simplify" them away)
#
# 1. FAIL CLOSED ON SCRATCH FAILURE. If mktemp fails (TMPDIR unset, full, or
#    read-only) an unchecked $home is EMPTY, and Hermes treats an empty
#    HERMES_HOME as unset -- falling straight back to the caller's real
#    ~/.hermes/state.db. The isolation helper would then silently cause the
#    exact corruption it exists to prevent. Every scratch path is validated and
#    the reviewer REFUSES to run without one.
#
# 2. NEVER CALL reviewer_pool_init IN COMMAND SUBSTITUTION. `P=$(...)` runs it
#    in a subshell whose EXIT trap fires the moment the substitution closes,
#    deleting the pool before use. `$$` cannot detect this (bash keeps the
#    parent's pid in a subshell) and BASHPID is empty on bash 3.2 (macOS). So
#    init EXPORTS nothing and RETURNS nothing -- it sets a global. Lazy
#    auto-init is a hard error for the same reason: it used to run inside
#    reviewer_run's own $(reviewer_home) substitution and self-destruct.
#
# 3. TRAPS DO NOT FIRE WHILE BASH BLOCKS IN A FOREGROUND CHILD. Measured: a
#    script SIGTERMed during a foreground `sleep` never ran its EXIT trap and
#    leaked its scratch; `sleep 60 & wait $!` cleaned up correctly. reviewer_run
#    therefore backgrounds and waits.
#
# 4. A SIGNAL HANDLER THAT DOES NOT EXIT LETS THE SCRIPT RESUME. Bash returns
#    control to the next statement after the handler, so a Ctrl-C'd fan-out
#    would destroy the pool and then happily seed a NEW one and keep spending
#    model calls. The INT/TERM handler kills live reviewers, restores the
#    default disposition, and re-raises.
#
# 5. CHAIN THE CALLER'S TRAPS, DO NOT CLOBBER THEM. This file is sourced into
#    the caller's shell; a bare `trap ... EXIT` silently replaces whatever
#    cleanup the caller already installed.
#
# 6. DO NOT EXPORT REVIEWER_POOL. An exported pool is inherited by child
#    shells, which then skip init, adopt the parent's pool, and delete it on
#    their own exit while the parent's reviewers are still running.
#
# WHAT WAS REJECTED
#   bare mktemp, unseeded   No credentials: "HTTP 401: Missing Authentication
#                           header" WITH EXIT CODE 0, so a fan-out silently
#                           scores dead reviewers as successful seats.
#   profiles/<name> + -p    Litters the profile namespace, needs sweep-on-crash,
#                           forces invented names; nested names fail rc=2.
#   MoA presets             Broadcasts ONE prompt to N models. A panel needs N
#                           DIFFERENT prompts. Different feature.
#   delegate_task per-task  Upstream refuses it (PRs #17718/#23266/#25026/
#   model override          #34773/#36790; maintainer: "We do not want this").
