"""jobrun — a scheduled-job execution adapter for Hermes cron.

This is an EXECUTION ADAPTER, not a scheduler. Hermes cron stays the scheduler.
jobrun owns the seven concerns scheduled jobs otherwise re-implement inconsistently:

  1. interpreter/dependency resolution   (kills the .sh-wrapper hack)
  2. silence-on-success                  (kills hand-rolled `if RC -ne 0` blocks)
  3. overlap prevention                  (flock)
  4. hard timeout + signal handling      (timeout distinguishable from failure)
  5. structured run ledger               (exit code, duration, outcome — cron's has none)
  6. bounded log capture                 (quiet-on-success != discard evidence)
  7. heartbeat / dead-man's-switch       (the ONLY thing that catches "never ran")

Contract with Hermes cron (no_agent=True jobs):
  - non-empty stdout  -> delivered verbatim to the human
  - empty stdout      -> SILENT
  - non-zero exit     -> scheduler raises a failure alert
jobrun preserves that contract exactly, so it is a drop-in for `script:`.

TERMINAL STATES (never collapsed into a bare exit 1):
  success | child_failure | timeout | signal | config_error | skipped_overlap
  | wrapper_error

Usage:
    jobrun.py --spec <name>            # run job defined in jobs.d/<name>.toml
    jobrun.py --spec <name> --dry-run  # validate spec + preflight, run nothing
    jobrun.py --selftest               # exercise every terminal state, exit 0/1

Exit codes (documented, stable — 126/127/128+ deliberately avoided):
    0   success, or a clean skipped_overlap
    2   config_error (bad spec, missing interpreter, unwritable paths)
    3   child_failure (the job itself exited non-zero)
    4   timeout
    5   signal
    6   wrapper_error
