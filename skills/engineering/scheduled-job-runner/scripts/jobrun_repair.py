jobrun repair dispatcher (v2) — bounded, auditable LLM self-repair.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
The owner was tired of finding failing cron jobs and then having to ask for a
fix manually. The catch: "if I have a five-minute job or a one-minute job ...
suddenly we're doing an LLM call every minute."

So this module exists to answer exactly one question, safely and repeatedly:

    A job just failed. Do we send a model at it, and if so, under what leash?

THE MEASUREMENT THAT SHAPED IT
-------------------------------
A watchdog on a short schedule produced dozens of timeout failures in one day.
A naive "failed, dispatch a fixer" design would have opened a model session for
every one of them, against a job that was healthy the whole time and failing
only because an upstream dependency was down.

The tests go further and simulate a 1-minute job, because the worry worth
designing against is a job on a 1/2/5-minute schedule, and the tightest cadence
is the one that has to hold.

Under this dispatcher that job gets **zero** dispatches, because timeouts are
not code defects (see ``jobrun_severity.repair_eligible``). The replay across
a representative failure replay is: many raw failures become a smaller set of
distinct conditions, then a still smaller repair-eligible set before budgets.
That reduction is the point.

STATE LIVES IN SQLITE, NOT JSON
--------------------------------
Never use JSON for agent-facing state. Concurrent cron ticks
would race a JSON file, and the ledger already proved that lesson once.

WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
------------------------------------------
It does not merge, deploy, restart anything, or edit a live script in place.
It requests a PR. Prior art is unanimous here: Sentry Seer, Copilot Autofix,
Dependabot, and Renovate all stop at a reviewable PR, and ITBench measured the
best agents resolving 13.8% of real SRE scenarios (arXiv:2502.05352). A 13.8%
solve rate is useful triage and an unacceptable auto-merge.

RULES, in priority order:

1. REPRODUCE FIRST. Run the job's script yourself and observe the failure

   an unreproduced fix is a guess.
2. DO NOT edit the live script in place. Work in an isolated clone and ship
   through the repository's normal PR cycle. Never merge, deploy, or restart
   anything yourself; return the reviewable PR to the owner.
3. DO NOT modify the job's schedule, its cron entry, or any other job. Never
   restart a service that was not affected by your change, and never flip a
   live-effect flag or a kill switch.
4. If the real defect is in the SPEC rather than the code (a timeout shorter
   than the job's own runtime, a cadence faster than its duration, a wrong
   working directory), say that plainly and propose the spec change. Do not
   rewrite working code to fit a broken spec.
5. If the failure is environmental (a missing credential, an upstream outage,
   a full disk), report it and stop. You cannot patch those.
6. Add or update a test that FAILS before your change and PASSES after. If the
   project has no test harness for this, say so rather than inventing one.
7. Keep the diff small. If the fix needs more than ~20 files or a redesign,
   stop and write up what you found instead.
8. You have {max_minutes} minutes. If you are not converging, stop and report.

Finish with a short report: what broke, why, what you changed, the PR URL, and
what you could not verify.
