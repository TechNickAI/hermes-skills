jobrun severity contract (v2) — classification, reconciliation, and dedup.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
v1 rendered severity from ``spec.critical``, a hand-set boolean describing the
JOB. Every failure of a flagged job therefore rendered "🛑 CRITICAL — this job
moves real money" at equal volume, whether the cause was a 120s network timeout
or a guard that had genuinely stopped guarding.

Two consequences seen in practice:

  * A watchdog on a short schedule produced dozens of timeout failures in a
    single day, each rendering its own red card. The job itself was healthy —
    its typical runtime was a small fraction of its ceiling — and the timeouts
    came from an upstream outage. Every duration landed on the ceiling exactly,
    which is the signature of a blocked call killed by the harness rather than
    organic slowness. Many identical red cards, one condition, no defect.
  * A guard job carried ``critical = true`` and claimed consequential effects while its wrapper explicitly selected a sandbox.
    The alarm was factually false.

Severity is a property of the RUN, not of the script. This module makes that
structural rather than advisory.

TWO EXIT CODE NAMESPACES — DO NOT COLLAPSE THEM
------------------------------------------------
``jobrun.py`` uses 0/2/3/4/5/6 for its OWN outward exit status to the scheduler.
This module classifies the CHILD process's exit code. They are different
namespaces on different process boundaries. The child band (10/20/30) was chosen
to be clear of every reserved range in BOTH directions:

    1        the existing hard-failure convention. NEVER redefine as
             WARNING: it would silently downgrade every legacy failure.
    2        shell builtin misuse; Python argparse; LSB "invalid argument"
    3-9      RESERVED, FORBIDDEN for domain meaning. See below.
    64-78    BSD sysexits.h (deprecated and nonportable, but still emitted)
    126,127  not executable / not found
    128+N    signal encoding
    200+     systemd launch failures (EXIT_CHDIR, EXIT_EXEC)

WHY 3-9 ARE FORBIDDEN FOR DOMAIN MEANING
-----------------------------------------
A job once encoded the research state "REINSTATE: positive-carry thesis holds"
as exit code 3. It "failed" 12 times in the retention window while working
perfectly. A script that invents private semantics inside the band the runner
reads as failure will be misclassified forever, and the author's own notes said
never to do this. Domain state goes in the sentinel's ``reason_code``, never in a
low exit code. This module raises on 3-9 so the mistake is loud.

REJECTED: the Nagios 0/1/2/3 ABI. 2 collides with shell-usage semantics, and
Nagios's 3=UNKNOWN is not monotonically more severe than 2=CRITICAL.
