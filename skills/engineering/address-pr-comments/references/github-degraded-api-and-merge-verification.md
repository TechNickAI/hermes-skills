# GitHub degraded-API and merge-verification patterns

Use these patterns when cleaning up PRs while GitHub intermittently returns 503s or a compound `gh` command exits non-zero.

## Review comments: REST 503 fallback

Do not interpret a failed `/pulls/<N>/comments` request as "no comments." Query GraphQL review threads instead:

```graphql
query ($owner: String!, $name: String!, $n: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequest(number: $n) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          comments(first: 20) {
            nodes {
              databaseId
              author {
                login
              }
              body
              path
              line
              reactions(first: 10) {
                nodes {
                  content
                  user {
                    login
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This exposes unresolved threads, replies, and reactions. Preserve the root comment's `databaseId`; once REST recovers, use it with the normal reply and reaction endpoints.

### Passing the GraphQL query correctly

**Do NOT inline the query as a JSON string in `-f query=...`.** GraphQL field definitions contain colons (`owner: String!`), and `gh api graphql -f query='...'` chokes on them with:

```
Expected VAR_SIGN, actual: COLON (":") at [1, 7]
```

Write the query to a `.graphql` file and use shell expansion:

```bash
cat > /tmp/prthreads.graphql << 'EOF'
query($owner: String!, $name: String!, $n: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequest(number: $n) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          comments(first: 20) {
            nodes {
              databaseId
              author { login }
              body
              path
              line
              reactions(first: 10) { nodes { content user { login } } }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF

gh api graphql -f query="$(< /tmp/prthreads.graphql)" \
  -F owner=<owner> -F name=<repo> -F n=<pr_number> \
  --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes
    | "threads=\(length) unresolved=\(map(select(.isResolved|not))|length)",
      (.[] | select(.isResolved|not) | {
        id:.comments.nodes[0].databaseId,
        author:.comments.nodes[0].author.login,
        path:.comments.nodes[0].path,
        line:.comments.nodes[0].line,
        replies: (.comments.nodes|length-1),
        reactions: (.comments.nodes[0].reactions.nodes|length),
        body:.comments.nodes[0].body[0:400]
      })'
```

The `-F` flag passes variables as typed GraphQL fields (String/Int), avoiding all shell quoting issues.

## Actions API 503: check-runs fallback

When `gh run list --branch=<branch>` or `gh run view <run_id>` returns HTTP 503 (GitHub Actions API degradation), poll CI status via the check-runs API on the commit SHA instead:

```bash
SHA=$(gh pr view <N> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/$SHA/check-runs \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | [.name,.status,.conclusion] | @tsv'
```

This endpoint is often available when the actions/runs endpoint is degraded. Check-runs also show `queued` status when GitHub is experiencing runner-queue delays — this is not a code problem; wait and re-poll.

## Compound merge command: verify the side effect

`gh pr merge N --squash --delete-branch` performs two independent operations. The merge may succeed while branch deletion fails with a transient API error, yielding a non-zero exit.

Before retrying:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N \
  --jq '{state, merged, merged_at, head:.head.ref}'
```

If `merged: true`, do not rerun the merge. Delete the branch separately:

```bash
git push origin --delete HEAD_BRANCH
```

Then re-list open PRs to verify the intended backlog is clear.

## Test runner discovery trap

A Django test-label command can return success while reporting `Ran 0 tests` for pytest-style test modules. Treat zero tests as failed verification, not success. Run the affected module explicitly with pytest:

```bash
python -m pytest path/to/test_module.py -q --maxfail=1 --ds=<settings>
```

After reviewer-driven edits, run pre-commit on the exact changed files, allow formatter hooks to modify them, rerun pre-commit, and rerun the targeted tests before pushing.
