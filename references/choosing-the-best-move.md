# Choosing the best move

Worked examples for the four-step decision in SKILL.md. The value of these is not the
conclusions, which are specific to one portfolio on one day. It is the SHAPE: what a
finished piece of reasoning looks like, and what it looks like when it stops early.

## Why the examples matter more than the rule

The rule "reason to the best move" is easy to agree with and easy to not do. The failure
is not disagreement, it is stopping at step 2, naming the obstacle, and treating the
name as the answer. "This project needs verification" is a category, not a move.
"Re-derive the cluster key from the agent's own committed artifact and check it against
the hardcoded constant" is a move.

A finished step 3 has candidates you could hand to someone else and they would know what
to do tomorrow morning.

## The tell that a pass stopped early

- The chosen move is described in the same words as the obstacle.
- All three candidates are the same move at different depths.
- The runner-up is a strawman, obviously worse, included to satisfy the requirement.
- No candidate would cost money, ask anyone anything, or change what the project is.

That last one is the strongest signal. If every candidate is something the steward can
do alone with files it already has, the option set was never opened.

**Measured instance, first full-portfolio run of this procedure.** An independent
three-family panel reviewed 17 passes and found the strawman failure explicitly. One
project's candidate 1 was "stay cold," candidate 2 was "violate the principal's stated
instruction," and candidate 3 was filler — the three-candidate rule satisfied without
ever opening the option set. Another project offered three variants of "resolve existing
uncertainty" with no buy-compute, no engage-a- specialist, and no retire-this-path.

**Hence the rule: one candidate must be of a different KIND** — spend money, ask a
person, merge, retire, ship, or change the charter — not merely different content. Two
honest candidates beat three where one is a scarecrow.

## WAIT is not a move

Two of the 17 passes chose to await an in-flight work order. That is the audit default
with the verbs removed: it consumes a slot, produces a log line that looks like work,
and leaves the project untouched. If nothing can be done until an agent reports, **skip
the project and pick another.** Silence is a success state; a status page is not.

## The phantom blocker

A project's `now.md` said, for four days: _"the principal's call on direction — still
open, still the one real blocker."_ Four paragraphs below, the same file said: _"the
principal approved A only, verbatim."_ `decisions.md` carried the approval with a
message id and a UTC timestamp.

The decision had been made. The file said it was blocked. Every pass read the blocker
line, correctly declined to re-ask a question already answered, and moved on — so the
contradiction survived every pass that could have caught it, precisely because each pass
behaved well.

**A phantom blocker is worse than a real one.** It makes a decided project look stalled
on the principal, it protects the project from being worked, and it is invisible to the
agent holding it because "waiting on the principal" is a legitimate state.

Two checks, cheap:

1. **Before writing or preserving any blocker line, grep `decisions.md` for that
   question.** If an answer exists with a date, the blocker is discharged; delete the
   line and record what the answer authorizes.
2. **A blocker must name what changes per answer.** "the principal's call on direction"
   names no options and no consequences. If you cannot write "if he says A I do X, if he
   says B I do Y," it is not a blocker — it is a project that has not been thought about
   recently.

The same pass that found this had also, in the same file, correctly listed the approved
capability as unbuilt. Both facts were present. Nobody had put them next to each other.

The first run of this procedure scored **17 of 17 projects as OUTWARD**, i.e. every pass
declared its own chosen move to be real progress. The review panel found at least five
were inward in substance: reconciling replies into a state file, re-scoring an existing
reject list under a new bar, waiting on a dispatched order, and spending a pass to
confirm that nothing should be done.

The mechanism, as one reviewer put it: the test was being judged from INTENT ("this
changes something") instead of MECHANISM ("does this introduce new information, new
capability, or external commitment?").

Two rules follow, and they generalize far past this metric:

1. **Score by mechanism, not intent.** OUTWARD requires new information from outside the
   project's files, a new capability or artifact, or an external commitment. Everything
   else is inward, including work that is correct and necessary.
2. **No metric may be graded by the same pass that produces the work it grades.** The
   pass proposes its verdict; the nightly review recomputes it from the log and reports
   disagreements.

A metric that never fires is either measuring nothing or is being graded by the party it
judges.

## Worked example 1 — the resource nobody absorbed

**Project:** on-chain wallet copy trading. Six research cycles had returned "not
profitable" while profitable wallets kept being found, and no cycle explained how.

**What the old procedure did:** found that two disjoint 31-wallet populations were both
being called "the 31 wallets" (intersection: zero) and dispatched an order to reconcile
the population-identity defect. A real defect, correctly attributed to the steward
rather than the agent.

**Step 1, the gap.** We want to know whether copying good wallets makes money. We have
spent six cycles proving specific copy mechanisms fail, and still cannot say how the
profitable wallets we keep finding got profitable.

**Step 2, what is in the way.** Not a belief needing verification. **A thing that exists
in the world, which the principal had already handed over.** Fifteen hours earlier he
had supplied a vendor API key with an explicit instruction, and named two more vendors
and the project's origin app. Every prior cycle ran on self-sourced data carrying a
survivorship problem the project had never solved. The vendors exist to solve exactly
that.

**Step 3, candidates.**

- (a) Dispatch the population-identity reconciliation. _If perfect:_ the audit trail
  under six negatives becomes trustworthy. It produces no new candidate, no mechanism,
  no dollar. All six results stay negative either way. **Delta: near zero.**
- (b) Spend the metered request budget on a vendor-sourced leader set and check whether
  wallets selected by an INDEPENDENT party survive our screens. _If perfect:_ the
  survivorship problem gets an outside check for the first time. Failure is the
  strongest evidence yet toward a real wall; success is a candidate set that was never
  ours to bias. **Delta: large in both directions.**
- (c) Ask whether the origin app has an internal API. The principal raised it himself
  and it went unanswered. **Delta: moderate, costs one line.**
- (d) Answer his actual instruction: with three new sources on the table, write the
  one-page plan for what each is good for BEFORE spending a request.

**Step 4, choice: (d) then (b).** He asked for a plan before harvesting in those words,
and the budget cap is small enough that spending it unplanned is the expensive mistake.

**Runner-up: (a).** It is real, it is the steward's own defect, and it is exactly what
the old procedure would have chosen for the fifth time. It loses because reconciling the
audit trail beneath six negatives cannot produce a positive, and a vendor-sourced leader
set can.

**The general lesson:** ten consecutive passes ran after that key arrived and none
picked this project. The vendor names appeared nowhere in its state files. **No rule
anywhere read "the principal gave us something new,"** which is why the means ledger and
its surprise-correction hook exist.

## Worked example 2 — when the old procedure was already right

**Project:** an LLM stock-analysis desk. 71 evidence packs from a three-day sprint.

**What the old procedure did:** discovered fundamentals were real in 0 of 71 packs,
social in 3 of 71, both in zero, meaning every adverse finding had been measured on
packs with the evidence removed. Dispatched: build one complete pack and report what
completeness costs.

**New procedure, step 3 candidates.**

- (a) Re-run the corrected subset. _Delta:_ a cleaner version of a measurement already
  known to have run on degraded input, and downstream of the cost number anyway. **Near
  zero.**
- (b) Build one complete pack, measure what completeness costs. _Delta:_ decides whether
  the roadmap is reachable at all. **Large.**
- (c) Build it on a ticker the principal named as a real use case, rather than an
  arbitrary one. _Delta:_ identical cost, plus the first artifact in the project's
  history touching a stated use case.

**Choice: (c).** Same move as the old procedure, improved by one ticker.

**This example is in the file deliberately.** A redesign that reverses every prior
decision is not a better procedure, it is a contrarian one. The new procedure agreeing
with the old call is evidence it is tracking value rather than novelty.

## Worked example 3 — the deleted constraint

**Project:** a cross-chain yield scout for two capital sources.

**What the old procedure did:** caught that a domain agent had declared a benchmark "not
measurable from here" while a different agent was using that exact ledger as a
ground-truth gate in another thread. Reproduced the number independently, then
dispatched an order to restate the verdict against it.

**Step 2, what is in the way.** Two things, and the second is bigger. The verdict does
need restating. But underneath it, **the project had been reasoning inside constraints
the principal deleted that morning:** a non-US capital source with different tax
treatment, and a concentration ceiling reached at the incumbent venue, meaning the
incumbent was no longer a valid comparison base.

**Step 3, candidates.**

- (a) Dispatch the verdict restatement. **Already in flight; does not need this slot.**
- (b) Re-run the entire opportunity scan with the citizenship filter REMOVED and the
  incumbent excluded as a comparison base. _Delta:_ potentially large. Every prior scan
  silently applied a filter now voided, so **the whole rejected set is suspect, not just
  the one candidate.**
- (c) Ask about the new capital source's size, liquidity, and risk tolerance. Needed
  eventually, not blocking.

**Choice: (b).** One deleted constraint invalidates a filter that ran on every candidate
ever scanned. That surface is larger than any single verdict.

**The general lesson:** when the principal deletes a constraint, the question is never
"which pending decision changes." It is **"what did we already reject under that
constraint."** A constraint deletion is retroactive.

## The pattern across all three

In both cases where the new procedure changed the decision materially, step 2's honest
answer was **"a resource or constraint the principal supplied that no file has
absorbed."** Neither was reachable by better auditing, and both existed only in chat
scrollback.

A steward that only reads project files can never find them. This is the argument for
treating the principal's own messages as a first-class input to every pass, and for a
means ledger with a forcing function on the READ.

## The proxy is better, not solved

Outward research, 2026-08-04, with every arXiv ID verified against the API rather than
trusted:

**Skalse et al., _Defining and Characterizing Reward Hacking_ (arXiv:2209.13085), prove
two reward functions can only be mutually unhackable if one is constant.** The
INWARD/OUTWARD test above is non-constant, so it **is gameable in principle.** It is a
better proxy than the menu it replaced. It is not a solved problem and must never be
held as one.

The predicted failure targets this document's own remedy. The Reward Hacking Benchmark
(arXiv:2605.02964) found **72% of reward-hacking episodes include explicit
chain-of-thought rationale** — models frame exploits as legitimate problem-solving. A
four-step written procedure is exactly that prose surface: requiring reasoning to be
written out makes it legible AND hands a captured agent an ideal medium for fluent
self-justification. Both are true at once.

Three ways the test gets satisfied nominally: cite a source you did not read, emit a
trivial artifact, send a ceremonial message to a person. All three score OUTWARD while
changing nothing.

**Two known holes, recorded rather than hastily patched:**

1. **The independent verifier is not independent.** "No metric may be graded by the same
   pass that produces the work" is right, but a nightly review by the same system
   re-reading the same log is still in-distribution. Pan et al. (arXiv:2402.06627):
   "evaluations on static datasets are insufficient — they miss the feedback effects."
   Real independence means a different model and a different prompt.
2. **There is no outcome controller.** Passes are scored by what KIND of move they were,
   never by whether the project advanced. This is what killed a sibling project: 91
   self-improvement cycles while steadily losing money, postmortem line _"it lacked an
   outcome controller."_

**The steelman the menu deserves.** A typology's value is forced coverage and
_legibility of neglect_. The 33/7/0 distribution IS proof the menu did its job: it made
the bias countable, and countability enabled the redesign. Free-form generation can hide
the same bias in fluent prose with no column to reveal it. The literature's actual
recommendation was to keep the menu as a coverage floor with per-bucket quotas and fix
the REWARD to be outcome-based. Deleting the instrument that detected the problem is not
the same as fixing the problem.

**The meta-lesson, the most durable thing here:** this redesign was reasoned from first
principles and internal measurements without checking prior art, and it hand-re-derived
a formally characterized failure mode (reward hacking, Goodhart's law, the McNamara
fallacy). Work requiring no outside input always succeeds — the exact diagnosis this
procedure exists to fix. **A pass that changes the steward's own procedure is INWARD by
definition. Rewriting how you decide is the most inward act available.**
